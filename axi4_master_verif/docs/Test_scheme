| Tier                     | Scope                                                                | “Level”                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Smoke**                | One-beat write/read, write-only, read-only                           | Block-level (sanity)       |
| **Basic**                | 1–16-beat bursts, random bursts, unaligned/partial-strobe            | Block-level (functional)   |
| **Stress & Corner-Case** | Very long bursts, back-to-back traffic, error injections             | Block-level (robustness)   |
| **System-Level**         | Two (or more) agents via virtual sequencer, interconnect arbitration | System-level (integration) |

– Smoke/Basic/Stress all live in tb/tests/{smoke,basic,stress} and drive a single agent + DUT.
– Only System-Level lives in tb/tests/system and uses a virtual sequencer to coordinate multiple agents (multi-master interconnect).
