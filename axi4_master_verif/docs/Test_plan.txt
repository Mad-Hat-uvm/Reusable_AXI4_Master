| Test ID | Test Name                | Purpose                                                               | Stimulus                                                                                           | Expected Result                                              |
| :-----: | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   TC1   | Single-Beat Write/Read   | Validate basic single-beat register access via AXI4-Lite control.     | AW/AR channels with `len=0`; write a known pattern; then read back from same address.              | Read data equals written pattern; OKAY responses.            |
|   TC2   | INCR Burst Write/Read    | Ensure correct address increment behavior for multi-beat transfers.   | Issue INCR bursts of lengths `{2,4,8,16}`; send corresponding W beats; then read same bursts.      | Data stored at successive addresses; OKAY on all beats.      |
|   TC3   | FIXED Burst Write/Read   | Confirm support for fixed-address multi-beat transfers (e.g., FIFOs). | Issue FIXED bursts (`len=0..7`) to a single address; write multiple beats; then read them back.    | All beats land at same address; data matches each beat.      |
|   TC4   | WRAP Burst               | Verify wrap-boundary handling when bursts cross an aligned region.    | Issue WRAP bursts (`wrap_size=4`) starting at misaligned boundary; length=3.                       | Addresses wrap within 4-beat boundary; data integrity holds. |
|   TC5   | Back-Pressure Stress     | Exercise driver’s ability to handle random ready-stall scenarios.     | Slave randomly de-asserts `AWREADY`/`WREADY`/`ARREADY` for 0–N cycles during transfers.            | No deadlocks; all transactions eventually complete.          |
|   TC6   | Error-Response Handling  | Test graceful handling of SLVERR/DECERR error codes.                  | Slave injects `SLVERR` or `DECERR` on a beat; driver must invoke error callback or retry logic.    | Error logged; sequence terminates or retries as designed.    |
|   TC7   | Outstanding Transactions | Validate ID-based ordering and concurrency per AXI4 spec.             | Issue up to N outstanding bursts with randomized IDs before checking any responses.                | Responses match original IDs; per-ID beat order preserved.   |
|   TC8   | Randomized Regression    | Achieve broad coverage across all parameter combinations.             | Randomize burst type, length, ID, alignment, back-pressure, and error injection over 200 seeds.    | No mismatches; coverage ≥95% across all bins.                |
|   TC9   | Two-Master Arbitration   | Ensure fair bus arbitration between multiple masters.                 | Instantiate two AXI4 masters driving bursts concurrently through a round-robin arbiter.            | No starvation; both masters complete their bursts.           |
|   TC10  | Performance Metrics      | Measure and verify latency/throughput against spec under stress.      | Timestamp issuance and acceptance for bursts `{1,4,16}` under no-stall and heavy-stall conditions. | Throughput meets target; latency within allowable range.     |
